LEARNING DIARY, FRONTEND

### April 14 - April 16
During this period, I began exploring YouTube course material on web development and gained an understanding of Sass. Initially, I was confused by the term "CSS preprocessor." However, I later realized that Sass processes its code into pure CSS, which browsers can interpret. I also learned about the utility of CSS variables for reusing code, especially for colors. Instead of altering color values individually throughout the stylesheet, you can simply modify the variable's value.

### April 17 - 19
I started grasping the concepts of `@mixin` and `@include`, which are used to create and invoke reusable CSS styles. `@mixin` is used for creation, while `@include` is used for invocation (calling). In the tutorial, separate Sass files were created for variables and mixins, which were then imported using the `@import` keyword. Initially, I was confused as to why CSS wasn't processing these files despite being Sass files. It dawned on me that files not intended for Sass processing should have an underscore before their name.

### April 21 - 25
Taking my learning further, I explored resources like W3Schools and Tutorials Teacher to deepen my understanding of Sass. Here, I discovered various Sass functions and resolved the confusion I had earlier. It became clear that to exclude a file from Sass processing, an underscore should come before the name.

### April 29 - May 2
Returning to the video course, I found the section on grids and flexbox relatively easy to comprehend, given my prior knowledge. The translating menu feature intrigued me, and I was pleased to learn about its implementation. Additionally, I learned how to push an SCSS project to GitHub. However, I am still facing challenges doing it on my own, as it keeps getting published without the gh-pages.

### May 3 - May 6
I began working on some trial projects using SCSS and encountered some challenges, such as hosting my project with GitHub Pages. However, I managed to overcome them with the aid of online resources and ChatGPT.

### May 7
I started working on the assignment project and encountered some challenges, which I later resolved. Initially, all my SCSS styles were in one folder, but I later separated them into different folders, which improved the organization and structure of my project.
